# UN-Migration-Analysis

Human migration is the movement by people from one place to another, particularly different countries, with the intention of settling temporarily or permanently in the new location. It typically involves movements over long distances and from one country or region to another.
Migrations are the essence of peopling the world and they are believed to have begun approximately 2 million years ago with the early expansions out of Africa by Homo erectus.
In more modern times, migrations have often been driven by necessity, that could include forced displacement (in various forms such as deportation, slave trade, trafficking in human beings) and flight (war refugees, ethnic cleansing).
This study is focused on analyzing the data to get insights on the migration dynamics, addressing questions such as:
• What are the major flows of migration (meaning from where to where)?
• Where people from the more developed regions are migrating to?
• Where people from the less developed regions are migrating to?
• What are the dynamics by income and geographic region?
• Drill down in one region of your choice, addressing questions similar to the above.
